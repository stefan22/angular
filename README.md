angular


go to your browser, and in the same window where your SpecRunner.html is loaded up, open your console (Google Chrome shortcut is cmd + option + i) and at the prompt intitialise an instance of Javabuzz(); as you did in your spec file:

var javabuzz = new Javabuzz();
and then throw some numbers at it:

>  javabuzz.says(3)
<- "Java"

>  javabuzz.says(5)
<- "Buzz"

>  javabuzz
